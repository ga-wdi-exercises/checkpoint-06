## Part I: Angular

### Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `blog` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency.

```js
// Your answer goes here...
angular
  .module('blog', [
    "ui.router"
  ])
```

### Question 2

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
```

```text
adding data- to an html doc allows the html to pass a validator.
```

### Question 3

Which of the three following options demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

```text
Your answer goes here...
A- this allows angular's scope to encompass then entire app. B would not work because angular app needs access to the body to allow for the data-binding and other functions. C would not work because the app is scoped under an angular command, so the site would hit an error before instantiating the app functions.
```

#### A

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### B

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### C

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Question 4

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh. Similarly, a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[X] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

### Question 5

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

```text
Your answer goes here...
ui-sref is the label used to route anchor tags in an html document in an angular app with a ui.router dependency.
```

## Part II: APIs & AJAX

### Question 6

Below is an `index` controller action that maps to a `Post` model in a Rails application. How would you modify it so that it can respond with a list of posts in either HTML or JSON form, depending on the incoming HTTP request?

```rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end
```

```rb
# Your answer goes here...
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { render :index }
      format.json { render json: @posts }
    end
  end
```

### Question 7

Let's say the Posts in the previous question are available at `http://localhost:3000/posts`. In a front-end application, how could you do the following using AJAX?
  1. Retrieve all the posts in JSON form
  2. If Step 1 is successful, print the resulting JSON to the console
  3. If Step 1 is unsuccessful, print an error message to the console

```js
// Your answer goes here...
$.ajax ({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/posts`,
  type: "GET",
  dataType: "json"
}).done((response) => {
  console.log(response)
}).fail(() => {
  console.log("There was an error")
})
```

### Question 8

Using the same front-end application and Rails API from the previous question, how would you use AJAX to create a Post through the API? You can assume the following...
* The API is RESTful
* The `PostsController` contains a strong params method that is used when creating an instance of the `Post` model
* Each Post has `title` and `body` attributes, both of which are strings

If the Post creation is successful, the new Post should be printed to the browser console. Otherwise, an error message should be printed to the console.

```js
// Your answer goes here...
$.ajax({
  url: `http://localhost:3000/posts`,
  type: "POST",
  dataType: "json"
  data: newPost(title=newPost.title&body=newPost.body)
}).done(() => {
  console.log("Post successful")
}).fail(() => {
  console.log("There was an error")
})
```
