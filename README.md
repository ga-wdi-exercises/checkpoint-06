## Part I: Angular

### Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `blog` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency.

```js
angular.module("blog, [ui.router]")
```

### Question 2

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
```

```text
data is used for HTML validation, just ng-click would not pass
```

### Question 3

Which of the three following options demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

```text
A - Because you want ng-app to be the root of your application in your HTML. You would not want it to be in the head because that isn't a part of what is displayed to the user.
```

#### A

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### B

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### C

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Question 4

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh, and a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[X] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

### Question 5

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

```text
it is used to link to another part of the application. Similar to an achor tag
```

## Part II: APIs

### Question 6

Below is an `index` controller action that maps to a `Post` model in a Rails application. How would you modify it so that it can respond with a list of posts in either HTML or JSON form, depending on the incoming HTTP request?

```rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end
```

```rb
class PostsController

  attr_reader :title, :body

  def initialize(city, state)

    url = "http://localhost:3000/posts"
    response = HTTParty.get(url)

    @title = response["title"]
    @body = response["body"]

  end
end
```

### Question 7

Let's say the Posts in the previous question are available when you visit `http://localhost:3000`. In a front-end application, how could you do the following using jQuery...
  1. Retrieve all the posts in JSON form
  2. If Step 1 is successful, print the resulting JSON to the console
  3. If Step 1 is unsuccessful, print an error message to the console

```js
$("button").on("click", () => {
  // Make sure to add your API key to the URL!
  var url = "http://localhost:3000/posts"
  $.ajax({
    url: url,
    type: "get",
    dataType: "json"
  }).done((response) => {
    console.log(response)
  }).fail(() => {
    console.log("Ajax request fails!")
  })
})
```

### Question 8

Using the same front-end application and Rails API from the previous question, how would you use jQuery to create a Post through the API? You can assume the following...
* The API is RESTful
* The `PostsController` contains a strong params method that is used when creating an instance of the `Post` model
* Each Post has `title` and `body` attributes, both of which are strings

If the Post creation is successful, the new Post should be printed to the browser console. Otherwise, an error message should be printed to the console.

```js
$(".post").on("click", () => {
  $.ajax({
    type: 'POST',
    data: {
      post: {
        title: "Rob's Motha Effin API",
        body: "The greatest API in existence"
      }
    },
    dataType: 'json',
    url: "/posts"
  }).done((response) =>  {
    console.log(response);
  }).fail(() => {
    console.log("AJAX POST failed");
  })
})
```
