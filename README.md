## Part I: Angular

### Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `blog` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency.

```js
let myApp = angular.module('blog',["ui.router"])
```

### Question 2

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
```

```text
adding "data" makes no differance as far as functionality goes. It just makes it so the html will pass a validator
```

### Question 3

Which of the three following options demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

```text
"A" because the app will be scoped to the entire html page. "B" makes no sence and "C" is a valid use if you want the app to only work inside that div.
```

#### A

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### B

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### C

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Question 4

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh. Similarly, a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[X] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

### Question 5

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

```text
ui-sref is a state reference. it is used to update the current state of the view to a new view. similar to actual links but without jumping to new pages.
```

## Part II: APIs & AJAX

### Question 6

Below is an `index` controller action that maps to a `Post` model in a Rails application. How would you modify it so that it can respond with a list of posts in either HTML or JSON form, depending on the incoming HTTP request?

```rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
  end
end
```

```rb
  respond_to do |format|
    format.html{render :index}
    format.json{render json: @posts}
  end
```

### Question 7

Let's say the Posts in the previous question are available at `http://localhost:3000/posts`. In a front-end application, how could you do the following using AJAX?  
    1. Retrieve all the posts in JSON form  
    2. If Step 1 is successful, print the resulting JSON to the console  
    3. If Step 1 is unsuccessful, print an error message to the console  

```js
$.ajax({
    url: "http://localhost:3000/posts",
    type: "get",
    dataType: "json"
}).done((data) => {
    console.log(data)
}).fail(() => {
    console.log("Ajax request fails!")
})
```

### Question 8

Using the same front-end application and Rails API from the previous question, how would you use AJAX to create a Post through the API? You can assume the following...  
    - The API is RESTful  
    - The `PostsController` contains a strong params method that is used when creating an instance of the `Post` model  
    - Each Post has `title` and `body` attributes, both of which are strings  

If the Post creation is successful, the new Post should be printed to the browser console. Otherwise, an error message should be printed to the console.

```js
$.ajax({
    type: "post",
    data: {
      post{
        title: "Some Title",
        body: "Some filler text"
      }
    },
    dataType: "json",
    url: "http://localhost:3000/posts",
}).done((response) => {
    console.log(reponse)
}).fail(() => {
    console.log("Ajax request fails!")
})
```
