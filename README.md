## Part I: Angular

### Question 1

Instantiate a new Angular module called `blog` that takes `ui.router` as a dependency.

```js
// Your answer goes here...
angular
  .module('blog', [
    "ui.router"
  ])
```

### Question 2

One button below has an `ng-click` attribute; the other has `data-ng-click` instead. What difference does it make?

```html
<button ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>
<button data-ng-click="vm.create()">Click</button>

```

```text

they are the same thing.
```

### Question 3

Which of the three following options demonstrates the best usage of `ng-app`? **Explain your answer.**

```text
Your answer goes here...
#### A
ng-app directives should be placed at the root of an HTML document

```

#### A

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html data-ng-app="myapp">
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### B

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head data-ng-app="myapp">
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

#### C

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My app</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1><a data-ui-sref="index">My App</a></h1>
    <div data-ng-app="myapp"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Question 4

Imagine an app in which a change to the view updates the model without a page refresh, and a change to the model updates the view without a page refresh.

Which one of the following concepts does this best illustrate?

```
[ ] A: Modularity
[ ] B: MVC
[x] C: Two-way data-binding
[ ] D: Separation of concerns
```

### Question 5

What is the `ui-sref` directive, and how is it used?

```text
Your answer goes here...
A directive that binds a link (<a> tag) to a state. If the state has an associated URL, the directive will automatically generate & update the href attribute via the $state.href() method. Clicking the link will trigger a state transition with optional parameters.
```

## Part II: APIs

### Question 6

Below is an `index` controller action that maps to a `Post` model in a Rails application. How would you modify it so that it can respond with a list of posts in either HTML or JSON form, depending on the incoming HTTP request?

```rb
class PostsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @posts = Post.all
    respond_to do |format|
      format.html { render :index }
      format.json { render json: @posts}
  end
end
```

```rb
# Your answer goes here...
respond_to do |format|
  format.html { render :index }
  format.json { render json: @posts}
```

### Question 7

Let's say the Posts in the previous question are available when you visit `http://localhost:3000`. In a front-end application, how could you do the following using jQuery...
  1. Retrieve all the posts in JSON form
  2. If Step 1 is successful, print the resulting JSON to the console
  3. If Step 1 is unsuccessful, print an error message to the console

```js
// Your answer goes here...
  1.$.post( "ajax/test.html", function( data ) {
    $( ".result" ).html( data );
  });
    .var jqxhr = $.post( "example.php", function() {
      alert( "success" );
    })
  2. .done(function() {
        alert( "second success" );
      })
  3..fail(function() {
        alert( "error" );
      })
      .always(function() {
        alert( "finished" );
      });


```

### Question 8

Using the same front-end application and Rails API from the previous question, how would you use jQuery to create a Post through the API? You can assume the following...
* The API is RESTful
* The `PostsController` contains a strong params method that is used when creating an instance of the `Post` model
* Each Post has `title` and `body` attributes, both of which are strings

If the Post creation is successful, the new Post should be printed to the browser console. Otherwise, an error message should be printed to the console.

```js
// Your answer goes here...
$(document).ready(function () {
  var name = $("#Title").val();
  var address = $("#Body").val();
        $.ajax({
            url: "http://localhost:3000/posts",
            type: "PUT",
            data: JSON.stringify([title, body]),

            success: function (data) {
              alert('Updated Successfully');
                window.location.href = "../Index";
            },
           error: function (msg) { alert(msg); }
         })
       })
     })
         ```
